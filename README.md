# Rust-vim

Vim clone with most minimal features made in rust to test my knowledge in rust.

## Plans on implementation

Took most of the inspiration from [here](https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto/)

As of now I just plan on making a command line text editor with insert mode and also the : to enter command feature of vim.

More features will be added later on when I feel like adding them or when someone decides to request a feature in the issues menu.
